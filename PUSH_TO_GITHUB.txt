STEP-BY-STEP: Push to GitHub and Build Mac Installer
================================================================================

CURRENT STATUS: ✓ Code committed locally, ready to push

NEXT STEPS:

1. CREATE GITHUB REPO (if not done already)
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Name: isuite-desktop (or any name)
   - Visibility: PRIVATE (important - to protect API keys)
   - Don't add README or .gitignore
   - Click "Create repository"

2. COPY YOUR REPO URL
   After creating, GitHub shows commands. Look for this line:
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/isuite-desktop.git

   Copy this URL!

3. ADD REMOTE & PUSH
   Run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):

   cd e:/IS/desktop
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/isuite-desktop.git
   git push -u origin main

   You may be asked to login to GitHub - use your credentials.

4. TRIGGER MAC BUILD
   - Go to your GitHub repo in browser
   - Click "Actions" tab
   - Click "Build Mac App" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" button (green dropdown)
   - Click "Run workflow" to confirm
   - Wait 10-15 minutes for build

5. DOWNLOAD MAC INSTALLER
   After build completes:
   - Click on the completed workflow run
   - Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
   - Click "iSuite-Assistant-Mac" to download
   - Unzip to get: iSuite Assistant-1.0.0.dmg

6. SEND TO MAC FRIEND
   - Upload .dmg to Google Drive / Dropbox / WeTransfer
   - Send download link to your Mac friend
   - They install like any Mac app

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:

If build fails:
- Check "Actions" tab for error logs
- Most common: Missing dependencies or build errors
- GitHub Actions is free (2000 mins/month)

If you need to rebuild:
- Make changes to code
- Run: git add . && git commit -m "Fix something" && git push
- Build triggers automatically OR manually trigger in Actions tab
